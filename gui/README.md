# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Loading the model

Run the training in the main project, with `yarn train` then put the resulting stored model into: `./public` as `generatorModel.json` and `weights.bin`.

The RGB model should be stored as `generatorModel-rgb.json` and `weights-rgb.bin`
